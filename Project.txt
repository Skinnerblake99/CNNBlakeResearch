This code base for the project is reserach being done by Blake Skinner for a final year project investigating the use 
of AI in automating insurance claims.The dataset that would accompany this code cannot be released with the project due to
nature of the data accquired from a private company.The code base has been made publically avaliable so the code can be viewed
attached to my paper.Note I have uploaeded the base code and if a different model is required other than the base ResNet50 model
this is simply swapped in for Resnet50 in the includes and the model name changed and then tweaking is done to each model depedning 
on results and subtle parameters are changed. 

FYPV2.py being the code to train the model and LoadaModelAndProduceData.py being able to take the trained model and produce
confusion matrix's and predictions from the models
